# Infrastructure 

The MyStore full stack application is hosted on the Amazon Web Services Cloud with the following services:

###  AWS RDS - relational database service instance running PostgreSQL : 
 It has many databases and SQL variants and provides easy management so we created our app using Postgres.
###  AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB) - scalable service hosting the API backend :
This is an orchestration service that allows you to run servers in multiple languages and runtimes;
Elastic Beanstalk is a free service that lets you easily run applications on web servers; where we hosted out Backend.
###  AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) - scalable storage hosting the UI front-end :
We will use this tool for configuring web hosting and for hosting files in general.
